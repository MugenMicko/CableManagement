PTFE Output Ramp Variations
Single, Double, Triple, Four, Five and Six Way Variations for the PTFE Ramp on FannyPack
These are to be used in conjunction with N3MI's backplate. When I went to use this, I found that the PTFE I/O didn't align with the output ramp
which would cause very tight bends in the PTFE which would cause excessive drag on the filament.  In a bid to resolve this, I relocated the PTFE
Ramp Coupler positions to make them as straight as possible.  This requires no additional hardware than would be used for the original.![474064032-17e6cb6a-1547-4506-8690-56f387100b78](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7192d2e9-84f4-4c53-9da4-f056910fa5b7)
